          When I&apos;m not working I enjoy walking my (Balinese) dog, shredding
          Dutch trails on my mountainbike (these can actually be challenging) or
          surfing small to medium sized waves, preferably in warm water.

          On the job I consider myself an extravert person with a keen eye for
          user-experience and visual design. I thrive in small teams where
          communication is open, honest feedback is appreciated and there&apos;s
          room for humour and legitimate personal interest.

          I&apos;m also an avid music lover. With Spotify playing 24/7 I might
          have some tracks for you to enjoy. Here&apos;s what I&apos;ve been
          listening to:
